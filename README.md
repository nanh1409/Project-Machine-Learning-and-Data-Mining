# About the project

Stroke is one of the major causes of death. 

In this project, we’re building a model capable of early predicting whether a patient is likely to get a stroke or not. The prediction is made by learning from thousands of patients. Each patient’s information includes gender, age, smoking status, hypertension status, marital status, etc.

Dataset source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)
